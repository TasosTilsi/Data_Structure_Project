# Data Structures - Project 

## Description

This repo contains my project on Data Structures course at TEI of Central Macedonia

### Project Description

Write a program that performs the following tasks:

- Create a table of integers p [ N ], where N = 30000, to be classified by the methods:
    - Bubble sort
    - Straight Selection sort
    - Straight Insertion sort
    - Quicksort

The table will assign unique random values ​​to the function
- int getUniqueNumber (int * p, int i)

and for each method will be calculated:
- the total run time of the sorting algorithm (in seconds)
- the number of items moved

Your program will run the quadruple of 20 sorting methods for 20 different original tables (using repeat) and will record the results in two different text files
